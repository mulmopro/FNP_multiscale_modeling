# FNP multiscale modeling

Simulation test case for modeling the Flash Nano Precipitation (FNP) via a multiscale approach (PBM-CFD) with Fluent.

Under the Documentation folder, you can find the published papers on this topic if you want to learn more about it.

Under the scripts folder, you can find the necessary files to run the simulation with Fluent. 
These files represent a specific case in terms of operating conditions, so you may change them by adjusting the appropriate variable. 
More details are also provided in the "Read me Fluent.pdf" file (ONLY Italian).
